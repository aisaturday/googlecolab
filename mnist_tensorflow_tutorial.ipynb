        "- Having exceptions dealing with misplaced shape\n",
        "<code>ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (100, 784) for Tensor 'convolutional/X:0', which has shape '(?, 28, 28, 1)'</code>\n",
        "\n",
        "This challenge becomes more and more apparent the deeper the network. Having a deeper network (.e.g. [GoogleNet](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf) ) with more parameters and layers for example can lead to situations where the shapes don't match. This is excarcebated by the fact that the final result is not known until after the static computational graph is run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building the computational graph step by step from small one layer onwards and testing continuously helped avoid this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Having a non-dynamic to see results of the neural network\n",
        "\n",
        "The very speed of tensorflow comes from its lazy evaluation of a computational graph. However, when we were building the neural network and wanted to having branching logic based on various criteria(e.e.g loss, different layer performance .etc.), it was not straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tensorflow now has an API to do [control flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/control_flow_ops) but it ends up not being pythonic and adds an additional layer of complexity to the neural network logic."
